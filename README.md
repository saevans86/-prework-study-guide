## Description

When I first started, I got up to the 3rd module and decided to delete the repo and begin again to make sure I was fully understanding what I was doing. By the second time around, the navigation of GIThub and GIT Bash was a lot easier. I really wanted to make this prework assignment look good, and it does look the way the guide intended. That being said, I could definitely use A LOT more practice with Java. The main issue I faced while working on the study guide was getting ahead of myself, and losing important things along the way, then having to go back and follow along again. By doing this I was able to see which mistakes I made along the way, as well as get to go through steps a second time and see how invested I become when I really want to figure something out.
